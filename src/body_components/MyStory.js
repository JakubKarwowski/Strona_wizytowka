            <h1>My Story</h1>
            <h2>2019</h2>
            <p>In 2019 I graduated from the Lodz University of Technology with the master degree of Automatic Control and Robotics. At my studies the subjects I most loved were ones connected with programming the industrial robots and also high-level programming. Just after studies although I did not have enough knowledge to start the work as a developer, I knew that my future lies in the IT industry. </p>
            <h2>2019-2021</h2>
            <p>I have taken  the opportunity to join the IT Operations team in one of the big corporations and did the internship there. Right now I work as an IT Onsite Support Engineer providing support for the company hiring over 1500 people. Working there I am responsible for the hardware stock, on and off-boarding process of the employees as well as for resolving multiple hardware and software issues of the user. I am also cooperating with the external service provided by the hardware supplier and with the IT Managers working for the company that is my employerâ€™s contractor.</p>
            <h2>2020-2021</h2>
            <p>In a meantime, I have attended the 6-level course preparing me to become the front-end developer. I have chosen the web development because as an aesthete I very like seeing the result of my work and this field allows me to do so. During the courses I have mentioned, I have taken part in 982 lectures spending there around 240 hours plus the time devoted to solving the problems and doing a lot of exercises on my own. </p>
